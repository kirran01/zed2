Hello Devs :) 

This repo is for a take home project assigned to me by Zedlabs. 

The purpose of this assignment was to simulate some functionality of a e-money payment service, using NextJS, Apollo, and GraphQL. I accomplished this by fetching data from the graphQL endpoint and manipulating the data to calculate and display a balance of transactions for a specific user (me, in this case!). In this case the balance is simply the difference between incoming and outgoing transactions that are updated within the GraphQL server.

I'm brand new to NextJS but seeing the power and potential of server side rendering on react components (and the option to NOT utilize them) is eye opening!

If you would like to see the demo, i've deployed it on Vercel. Have a look!
